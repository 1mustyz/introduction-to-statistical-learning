# 📘 An Introduction to Statistical Learning — Notes, Labs, and Exercises

This repository is my personal companion to the book **[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)** (ISL), where I take structured notes, replicate labs, and solve the end-of-chapter exercises using both **Python** and **R**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repo is organized into two main directories:

### `islp/` (ISL with Python)

- Contains notes, labs, and exercise solutions for each chapter implemented in **Python**
- Follows the structure of the **ISLP (Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python)** adaptation of the book
- Utilizes libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, and `statsmodels`

### `islr/` (ISL with R)

- Contains notes, labs, and exercise solutions for each chapter implemented in **R**
- Closely follows the original code and methods from the **ISLR (Introduction to Statistical Learning with R)** edition
- Uses R packages such as `ISLR`, `ggplot2`, `caret`, `MASS`, and base R functions

## ✅ Goals

- Build a strong foundational understanding of statistical learning concepts
- Compare and practice implementing models in both **R** and **Python**
- Maintain a clear and reusable reference for revision and future projects

## 📚 Chapters Covered

Each folder inside `islp/` and `islr/` is named after a corresponding chapter in the book. Inside each chapter folder, you’ll typically find:

- 📓 `notes.md` – Conceptual summaries
- 💻 `lab.ipynb` / `lab.R` – Code from the chapter labs
- 📝 `exercises.ipynb` / `exercises.R` – Solutions to end-of-chapter exercises

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is a living repository that I update as I progress through the book. Contributions, feedback, or suggestions are welcome!
